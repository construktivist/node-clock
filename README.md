# node-clock

## Summary

This is a very basic node.js application that doesn't have any UI. I built this to mess around with node.js. It logs the current date and time in addition to setting an alarm using arguments passed to it.

## How to use

  You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run this application.

  * `npm install` to install dependencies.
  * `node clock` will log the current date and time.
  * `node set-alarm MM-DD-YYYY HH:mm am or pm` will store an alarm.
  * `node alarm` will log the alarm.

  That is pretty much all there is to it.
